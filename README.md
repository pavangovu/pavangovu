### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at the University of Texas at Dallas, pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I've also been a software development engineer intern at Ericsson for the past year.

I graduated high school from the Texas Academy of Math and Science (TAMS), a highly selective early-college-entrance residential STEM program for gifted students, where I conducted research on IoT security software for smart home and hospital devices. 

After I came to UTD, I was admitted into CSÂ², the computer science honors program. Since then, I've won three hackathons, was employed by Trusted World Nonprofit as a full-stack engineer, presented my historical data mining, NLP research in a university-wide symposium, and have taken countless upper-level computer science courses, ranging from Machine Learning to Databases to Cybersecurity.
